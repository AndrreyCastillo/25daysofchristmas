I will be doing these challenges inside of a Kali Linux virtual machine 
because kali has a lot of the tools we need out of the box. And it also keeps
us from *breaking* our own machine.

TryHackMe provides a deployable Kali machine, but that one isn't free, so this is the next best thing!
I'm using VirtualBox.

Here is a good guide on how to set up Kali inside of a virtual machine:

Also, running openvpn on your host machine will work. So, you don't have to install it again on Kali.  

For each day/challenege TryHackMe provides great supporting material for how to get started in it.
The challenges are not easy at times, but they're not too hard either with the extra support from TryHackMe.
